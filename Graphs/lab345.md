## Laboratory Work Overview

### Laboratory Nr. 3: Empirical Analysis of Search Algorithms

**Subject:** Depth First Search (DFS) & Breadth First Search (BFS)

**Goals:**

1. Implement DFS and BFS in a programming language of your choice.
2. Define input data properties (graph size, density, structure) for testing.
3. Select performance metrics (e.g., execution time, memory usage, number of visited nodes).
4. Perform empirical runs on varying graph topologies and sizes.
5. Visualize results with graphs to compare behaviors.
6. Draw conclusions on algorithmic strengths and trade-offs.

### Laboratory Nr. 5: Dynamic Programming on Graphs

**Subject:** Dijkstra & Floyd–Warshall Algorithms

**Goals:**

1. Study the dynamic programming paradigm and its application in shortest-path problems.
2. Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm (single-source shortest path) and Floyd–Warshall algorithm (all-pairs shortest path).
3. Conduct empirical analysis on both sparse and dense graph instances.
4. Evaluate impact of increasing node counts on performance.
5. Present data graphically and prepare a comprehensive report.

### Laboratory Work Nr. 7: Greedy Algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees

**Subject:** Prim & Kruskal Algorithms

**Goals:**

1. Explore the greedy design technique and its characteristics.
2. Implement Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for computing minimum spanning trees.
3. Perform empirical tests on graphs with varying sizes and densities.
4. Analyze how graph growth affects runtime and memory.
5. Create visualizations to illustrate algorithm comparison and prepare the final report.

## Development & Testing

* **Language:** Choose between C++, Java, Python, or any performant language.
* **Graph Generation:** Use libraries or custom scripts to create random graphs of controlled density.
* **Benchmarking:** Automate runs with scripts (e.g., shell, Python) to gather timing and memory metrics.
* **Visualization:** Leverage tools like Matplotlib, GNUplot, or Excel for plotting results.
* **Reporting:** Summarize findings, include graphs, tables, and clear conclusions in each report.
